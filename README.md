## Key Design Principles

### Simplicity First
- Functions under 20 lines
- Components under 150 lines  
- Single responsibility per file
- Minimal external dependencies

### User Experience
- **Session Mode Priority**: Optimized for live sessions
- **Historical Context**: Always show previous review data
- **Professional Interface**: No emojis, clean design
- **Performance**: Fast load times, responsive interactions

### Business Rules
- Hierarchical reporting relationships (max 5 levels)
- One active round per quarter/year
- Complete reviews required before round completion
- Historical data preservation after round completion

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production  
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

# Testing (Required - see Testing Policy below)
npm test             # Run all tests in watch mode
npm run test:unit    # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests only
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
```

### üö® Testing Policy (IMPORTANT)

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALL code changes must include tests FIRST before implementation.**

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
1. **Write tests FIRST** for any new features or bug fixes
2. **Update existing tests** when modifying functionality  
3. **Verify all tests pass** before committing changes
4. **Maintain 95%+ coverage** for utility functions, 80%+ for business logic

**Test Structure:**
- `tests/unit/` - Fast, isolated function/component tests
- `tests/integration/` - Multi-service workflow tests  
- `tests/e2e/` - Critical user journey tests

**For any conversation with Claude Code:**
Always remind Claude to write/update tests BEFORE making code changes!

### Code Style
- No unnecessary comments (code should be self-explanatory)
- Explicit imports and clear naming
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Consistent error handling

## Deployment

This is a static React application that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

### Netlify/Vercel
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder

### Traditional Web Server
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Copy contents of `dist` folder to web server
3. Configure server to serve `index.html` for all routes

## Data Storage

The application uses browser localStorage for data persistence:

- **Storage Keys**: `tt_business_analysts`, `tt_talent_rounds`, `tt_reviews`
- **Data Format**: JSON objects stored as strings
- **Capacity**: ~5-10MB depending on browser
- **Backup**: Use Settings > Export Data for backups

## Browser Support
