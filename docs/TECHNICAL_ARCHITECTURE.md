## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture Pattern
The system follows a **Service-Oriented Client Architecture** pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           React Components          │ ← UI Layer
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Zustand Stores           │ ← State Management
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Service Layer              │ ← Business Logic
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Storage Utilities          │ ← Persistence Layer
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Architecture
Components follow a hierarchical structure optimized for maintainability:

```
App.tsx
├── Layout.tsx (Header, Sidebar, Navigation)
├── Router.tsx (Client-side routing)
└── Page Components:
    ├── Dashboard.tsx
    ├── BAManagement.tsx
    ├── RoundManagement.tsx  
    ├── ReviewEntry.tsx
    ├── SessionMode.tsx (Critical workflow component)
    ├── HistoricalAnalysis.tsx
    └── Settings.tsx
```

### Service Layer Design
Four core services handle business logic:

1. **BusinessAnalystService**: Staff management, org chart, hierarchy validation
2. **TalentRoundService**: Review rounds, lifecycle management, analytics
3. **ReviewService**: Individual reviews, historical trends, completion tracking
4. **DataExportService**: JSON export/import, backup/restore

### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Input → Component → Service → Storage → State Update → UI Refresh
```

All data modifications follow this pattern ensuring consistency and predictability.

---

## Data Architecture

### Storage Strategy
**Primary Storage**: HTML5 localStorage
**Storage Keys**:
- `tt_business_analysts`: Staff records
- `tt_talent_rounds`: Review rounds  
- `tt_reviews`: Individual reviews
- `tt_app_config`: Application settings

### Data Models & Relationships
```
BusinessAnalyst (1) ←→ (0..1) BusinessAnalyst (line manager)
BusinessAnalyst (1) ←→ (0..n) Review
TalentRound (1) ←→ (0..n) Review
```

### Data Integrity Measures
- **Referential Integrity**: Line manager references validated on creation/update
- **Circular Reference Prevention**: Org chart validation prevents infinite loops
- **Soft Deletion**: Staff deactivation preserves historical data
- **Atomic Operations**: localStorage operations wrapped in try/catch blocks
- **Data Validation**: TypeScript interfaces + runtime validation utilities

### Data Persistence Patterns
```typescript
// Generic storage pattern used throughout
const saveToStorage = <T>(key: string, data: T[]): void => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to save to ${key}:`, error);
    throw new Error(`Storage operation failed`);
  }
};
```

### Backup & Recovery
- **Export Format**: Complete JSON dump with timestamps
- **Import Validation**: Schema validation before data restoration
- **Partial Recovery**: Import process validates each entity individually
- **No Automatic Backups**: Manual export required (intentional for data control)

---

## Security & Compliance

### Data Security Model
**Security Level**: Client-side application with local data storage
**Data Classification**: Internal business data (performance reviews)

### Security Measures Implemented
1. **Client-Side Only**: No network transmission of sensitive data
2. **Input Sanitization**: All text inputs trimmed and validated
3. **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in XSS protection via JSX
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents common injection vulnerabilities
5. **No External APIs**: Eliminates attack vectors from third-party services

### Data Privacy Considerations
- **Local Storage Only**: Data never leaves user's device
- **Export Control**: Users control when/where data is exported
- **No Telemetry**: Application sends no usage data externally
- **Session Storage**: No persistent sessions or cookies

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data remains on user's device, no processing by third parties
- **Data Retention**: Users control data lifecycle through manual management
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Data can be deleted by clearing localStorage
- **Data Portability**: JSON export provides complete data portability

### Security Limitations & Risks
- **No Authentication**: Anyone with device access can view data
- **localStorage Persistence**: Data survives browser sessions
- **No Encryption**: Data stored in plain text in localStorage
- **Device Dependency**: Data loss if device is compromised/lost

---

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Characteristics
**Target Load**: 40-50 Business Analysts, 4 review rounds/year
**Expected Data Volume**: ~200 reviews/year, ~500MB localStorage max

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtual Scrolling**: Not implemented (not needed at current scale)
2. **Memoization**: Strategic use of React.memo for expensive components
3. **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting via React.lazy (not currently implemented)
4. **Efficient Rendering**: Key-based lists, minimal re-renders
5. **Local Computation**: All analytics computed client-side

### Scalability Limits
- **localStorage Quota**: 5-10MB typical limit (sufficient for 1000+ BAs)
- **JSON Parsing**: Performance degrades with >10MB data sets
- **Memory Usage**: Holds all data in memory (limitation at ~1000 BAs)
- **UI Responsiveness**: Table rendering slows with >500 rows

### Scalability Solutions
If scaling beyond current limits:
1. **Pagination**: Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
2. **IndexedDB Migration**: Replace localStorage for larger storage
3. **Web Workers**: Move heavy computations off main thread  
4. **Incremental Loading**: Load data in chunks rather than all at once

### Performance Monitoring
Current performance targets:
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Navigation**: < 500ms between views
- **Form Submission**: < 300ms save operations
- **Search/Filter**: < 100ms response time

3. **Cloud Backup**: Store exports in secure cloud storage
4. **Documentation**: Maintain user guides for data recovery

#### Service Level Expectations
- **Uptime**: 99.9% (dependent on hosting platform)
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for normal operations
- **Data Recovery**: Manual process, requires user-initiated exports

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Current Monitoring
**Application Level**: None implemented
**Platform Level**: Vercel/Netlify provides:
- Build success/failure notifications
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking (limited)

### Recommended Monitoring (Future)
```typescript
// Error tracking could be added:
window.onerror = (message, source, lineno, colno, error) => {
  console.error('Application error:', { message, source, lineno, error });
  // Could send to monitoring service
};
```

### User Analytics
**Current**: None (by design)
**Privacy-First Approach**: No user tracking or analytics implemented
**Performance Monitoring**: Browser dev tools only

### Logging Strategy
**Client-Side Logging**: Console logging for errors
**No Server Logs**: Static hosting provides access logs only
**User-Controlled**: No automatic error reporting

### Performance Metrics
Manually monitor via browser dev tools:
- **JavaScript bundle size**: Currently ~500KB
- **Initial page load**: < 2 seconds target
- **localStorage operations**: < 10ms typical
- **Component render times**: React Profiler available
