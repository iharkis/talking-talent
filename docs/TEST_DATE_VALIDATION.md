# Date Validation Test Results

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Validation Issue
**Problem**: Setting "8th August" as deadline was failing validation
**Root Cause**: Date validation was checking `deadline <= new Date()` which failed due to time-of-day differences
**Solution**: Updated validation to compare dates at start-of-day (00:00:00)

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
if (!data.deadline || data.deadline <= new Date()) {
  errors.push('Deadline must be in the future');
}

// After (fixed)
if (!data.deadline) {
  errors.push('Deadline is required');
} else {
  const today = new Date();
  today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Set to start of today
  const deadlineDate = new Date(data.deadline);
  deadlineDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Set to start of deadline day
  
  if (deadlineDate < today) {
    errors.push('Deadline cannot be in the past');
  }
}
```

### 2. UK Date Format
**Problem**: Application was inconsistent with date formats
**Solution**: Enforced UK format (DD/MM/YYYY) throughout

- Date display: Uses `dd/MM/yyyy` format with `enGB` locale
- Date inputs: Added helper text showing UK format
- Date validation: Now allows dates from today onwards (not just future)

## Test Cases

### ✅ Should Work Now
- Setting deadline to "08/08/2024" (8th August 2024)
- Setting deadline to today's date
- Setting deadline to any future date

### ❌ Should Still Fail (Correctly)
- Setting deadline to yesterday or any past date
- Leaving deadline field empty
- Invalid date formats

## UI Improvements

1. **Date Input Fields**: Now show minimum date as today
2. **Helper Text**: Shows current date in UK format as reference
3. **Consistent Formatting**: All dates display in DD/MM/YYYY format
4. **UK Locale**: Uses British English date formatting throughout

## Files Modified

- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Fixed date validation logic
- `src/utils/date.ts` - Added UK locale and input formatting
- `src/components/RoundManagement.tsx` - Updated date input with UK format hints
- `src/components/BAManagement.tsx` - Improved date input handling

The system now properly handles UK date formats and allows setting deadlines from today onwards, resolving the "8th August" validation issue.
